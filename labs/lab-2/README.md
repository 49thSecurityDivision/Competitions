# Web Vulnerbility Scanning
This lab will introduce and familarize students with web application scanner tools like burpsuite and owasp zap. The goal is to help students set up an environment for learning.

## Lab
1. Start [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) container with the following command.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

2. The website is now reachable from your local browser at http://127.0.0.1:4230
    * At this point, it would be a good practice to check out the [owasp top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
    * burpsuite and owasp zap are useful tools for conducting this experiment but will not be neccessary to discover all vulnerbilties

3. Familarize yourself with your tool of choice.
    * As a first step, try to get access into the web application portal
